Law Game 4 is an AI-powered courtroom simulation that lets users experience real-time legal scenarios. Users can present prosecution or defense arguments, and the system identifies relevant laws from the Indian Penal Code, Constitution, and legal indices.

Using NLP techniques like spaCy and Sentence-BERT, the game semantically matches user arguments to laws and simulates possible courtroom outcomes. Responses are delivered in text and audio, supporting English, Hindi, Telugu, Tamil, Kannada, and Malayalam.

This interactive game is designed for law students, educators, and legal enthusiasts to practice case analysis, understand courtroom procedures, and learn the practical application of Indian laws.
